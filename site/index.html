                <h3>As a University of Michigan student, it's often natural to wonder how the difficulty of courses differ among the schools. If you're curious, scroll down.</h3>

                <h2>Lots of courses at the University of Michigan.</h2>
                <p>
                    And it's hard to make sense of them. With the help of <a href='https://atlas.ai.umich.edu/'>Atlas</a>, a data display tool about the U-M curriculum, students can easily look up individual courses.

                <p>
                    But how about the aggregates? On the left is all the courses administered from the winter of 2016 to the fall of 2018, in popular subjects. Each circle is course, sized by how many students took it. Overwhelming, right?

                <h2>And put average GPA on the X-axis.</h2>
                <p>
                    Clearly, the popular Engineering school and LSA is stricter with grading. The School of Eduction, on the other hand, has an average GPA of 3.87. Contrary to popular belief, the Art School and Architecture School is quite demanding. Below is a wholistic
                    list of average GPA among schools, and you can explore the easier and most difficult classes by hovering over them.
