This course surveys key themes in the history of architecture and urbanism from antiquity to the present.  The course is intended to introduce students to leading developments in the history and theory of architecture and urban design, both and chronologically and thematically.  The scope of material covered in this course is broad in geographical terms, and will include settings in Europe, Asia, The Americas and Africa.  The course seeks to illuminate ways that architecture has historically been shaped by the formal and theoretical intentions of the architect, the preference and needs of the client, and the particular mix of social, economic, cultural and technical practices present in a given time and place.  Our objective is to provide a conceptual framework to help students both digest a substantial body of visual and factual information, and develop new habits of seeing, analyzing and thinking critically about architecture.",30,3.273333333,3.283333333,1,7,9,4,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,77,83,29,68,54

The sequence continues in the integration and translation of the knowledge, understanding, experience and skill gained in previous courses into architectural solutions to satisfy given needs, conditions and means.  The primary emphasis is the development of insight into the solution of building and environmental design problems:  how they are studies (analysis), how they are approached and carried through (process) and how they are conceptualized and developed (synthesis).  Assigned projects require the student to consider issues of human scale and behavior, environmental responsibility and building construction at a level of greater complexity than previously encountered.",38,3.684210526,3.7,2,11,16,7,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,94,89,41,83,85

This course prepares secondary education students to identify and use technologies that are appropriate for their grade levels and content areas.  A culminating project is required.  Students, in cooperation with field placement mentors, will design an extended unit plan that integrates the use of technology and enact the unit in their classroom placement sites.  Students will be encouraged to critically examine links between the use of various technologies and student learning.",41,3.909756098,3.909756098,0,35,2,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,63,82,21,89,68

The sequence continues in the integration and translation of the knowledge, understanding, experience and skill gained in previous courses into architectural solutions to satisfy given needs, conditions and means.  The primary emphasis is the development of insight into the solution of building and environmental design problems:  how they are studies (analysis), how they are approached and carried through (process) and how they are conceptualized and developed (synthesis).  Assigned projects require the student to consider issues of human scale and behavior, environmental responsibility and building construction at a level of greater complexity than previously encountered.",31,3.587096774,3.587096774,0,10,11,6,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,94,89,41,83,85
